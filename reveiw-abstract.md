## Review
### A Practical Survey on Faster and Lighter Transformers
#### Abstract
Transformer's effectiveness comes at the expense of a quadratic computational and memory complexity with respect to the sequence length. This survey investigates popular approaches to make the Transformer faster and lighter, and provides a comprehensive explanation of the methodsâ€™ strengths, limitations, and underlying assumptions.

#### Highlight
1. Good analysis of transformer with detailed explanation
